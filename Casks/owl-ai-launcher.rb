  caveats <<~EOS
    OWL needs at least one AI CLI on your PATH. Claude Code:

      https://claude.com/claude-code

    Gemini CLI is supported too, and others can be added in
    Settings → AI Tools.

    Picking a Terminal colour theme installs profiles named "OWL — <theme>"
    into Terminal. Your own profiles are read but never modified; remove ours in
    Terminal → Settings → Profiles. Profiles named "Claude — <theme>" are
    leftovers from before the rename and can be removed the same way.
